    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 1, 2025</p>

    <p>
      At <strong>Galaxy Copiers and Services</strong>, we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of privacy and confidentiality for every customer. This Privacy Policy explains in clear and transparent terms how we collect, use, protect, and delete any data shared with us — whether through digital files, emails, WhatsApp messages, or physical documents.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Documents submitted via pen drive, email, WhatsApp, or other devices for printing, scanning, or photocopying.</li>
      <li>Basic contact details if needed for service communication.</li>
      <li>Service-specific preferences (e.g., number of copies, paper type, format).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Purpose of Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We collect data strictly to complete the requested service and communicate updates related to your work order. We do not use or access any personal information unless it is directly relevant to the job.</p>

    <h2>3. Handling of Data Received via WhatsApp & Email</h2>
    <p>We accept documents via <strong>WhatsApp</strong> and <strong>Email</strong> for your convenience. We apply the same privacy standards across all channels:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Cloud Backups:</strong> Files are downloaded temporarily and not stored in any cloud or synced service.</li>
      <li><strong>No Forwarding:</strong> Files received are never shared or forwarded to any other number, email, or device.</li>
      <li><strong>Immediate Deletion:</strong> After the printing/scanning work is completed, the files are deleted from our email inbox or WhatsApp chat, including from download folders.</li>
      <li><strong>Screenshot Policy:</strong> We do not take screenshots or copies of any confidential material shared via these platforms.</li>
      <li><strong>Respect for Read Receipts:</strong> We use business WhatsApp responsibly — no auto-forwards, promotions, or spam messages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Deletion Policy</h2>
    <p>We follow a strict <strong>“delete-after-service”</strong> protocol:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Digital Files:</strong> All files (from USBs, email, or WhatsApp) are deleted as soon as the work is delivered.</li>
      <li><strong>Scanned Files:</strong> After handing over via drive, email, or phone, we permanently remove them from our system.</li>
      <li><strong>Physical Originals:</strong> Returned immediately. Any forgotten originals are shredded after 24 hours.</li>
      <li><strong>Manual Checks:</strong> Staff manually confirms deletion, and no recycle bin backups are retained.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not retain your data for future use unless explicitly asked by you in writing (e.g., for repeat orders).</p>

    <h2>5. How We Protect Your Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Computers and storage devices are password protected and monitored.</li>
      <li>Antivirus software is updated regularly to prevent any breach or infection.</li>
      <li>Only trusted, trained personnel are allowed to access customer files.</li>
      <li>We do not store customer files on any online platforms or shared folders.</li>
      <li>All operations are done on local devices and cleared immediately after use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. No Data Sharing with Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We <strong>do not</strong> sell, rent, or disclose any customer information to third-party vendors, advertisers, or external agents. All data stays within our workspace until deletion.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights as a Customer</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You may request proof of deletion at the time of delivery.</li>
      <li>You can opt to share files via a method you trust (WhatsApp, email, USB, etc.).</li>
      <li>You may decline to share personal contact details — anonymous jobs are also accepted when possible.</li>
      <li>You can ask us not to store or reuse any information from a previous order.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Our Transparency Promise</h2>
    <p>We believe privacy isn’t just a policy — it’s a responsibility. At Galaxy Copiers and Services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Every job is treated with 100% confidentiality</strong> — no matter how big or small.</li>
      <li><strong>We will never ask for more data than necessary</strong> to complete your request.</li>
      <li><strong>You remain in control</strong> of what is shared, when, and how it's handled.</li>
      <li><strong>All communication is discreet, secure, and respectful.</strong></li>
    </ul>
