    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 1, 2025</p>

    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>Galaxy Copiers and Services</strong>. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our services, including printing, photocopying, scanning, and file-related operations. By availing our services in person or remotely, you agree to the following terms:
    </p>

    <h2>1. Scope of Services</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We provide document printing, photocopying, scanning, lamination, and basic formatting assistance.</li>
      <li>We accept files via USB devices, WhatsApp, email, and direct uploads (where applicable).</li>
      <li>We do not offer document editing or correction services unless explicitly stated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Order Acceptance & Processing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Orders are accepted only after clear confirmation from the customer, either verbal or written (e.g., WhatsApp message).</li>
      <li>Once processed or printed, files cannot be reprinted without a new charge unless an error was caused by us.</li>
      <li>In case of payment delay or communication gap, Galaxy Copiers and Services may decline or delay service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. File Handling & Accuracy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We print exactly what is sent — the customer must ensure files are in final form and ready for printing.</li>
      <li>Galaxy Copiers is not responsible for typos, formatting errors, or incorrect page numbers in submitted files.</li>
      <li>We recommend submitting PDFs for better alignment; Word files may shift formatting depending on device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Use of WhatsApp and Email</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We use WhatsApp and email for file sharing purely for convenience.</li>
      <li>No files are stored permanently — everything is deleted after the job is completed.</li>
      <li>We do not share or forward any customer documents to third parties.</li>
      <li>Customer chats and email threads are not used for any marketing or non-service communication.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Confidentiality & Privacy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All files are handled confidentially with utmost care.</li>
      <li>Files are deleted immediately upon order completion — both from device and communication platforms.</li>
      <li>No files are uploaded to cloud, unless explicitly requested by the customer (e.g., Google Drive delivery).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Pricing & Payments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Prices for services are informed prior to execution wherever possible.</li>
      <li>Bulk orders may require advance payment or part payment confirmation.</li>
      <li>Refunds are not issued for completed services unless there is a proven error on our part.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Order Collection & Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All printed or scanned items must be collected within 3 days unless arranged otherwise.</li>
      <li>Forgotten printouts may be discarded or shredded after 7 days to maintain space and privacy.</li>
      <li>We are not responsible for unclaimed originals or printouts after 7 days.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Liability</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We are not liable for losses due to file corruption, printing errors caused by faulty input, or missing pages.</li>
      <li>While we ensure best practices, Galaxy Copiers cannot guarantee error-free output from improperly formatted files.</li>
      <li>We reserve the right to refuse service that violates copyright, legal, or moral boundaries (e.g., offensive content, fake documents).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Modifications to Terms</h2>
    <p>
      Galaxy Copiers and Services reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time. Updated terms will be available in-store and on request. Continued use of our services after modifications implies acceptance of the revised terms.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Customer Acknowledgement</h2>
    <p>
      By submitting files or placing a service order, the customer acknowledges they have read, understood, and agree to these Terms of Service.
